<h2>Page removed.</h2>

<p>Sorry, we've removed some of parts of the site that were completely out
of date. In most cases, that content has been moved into 
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/">the new documentation site</a>.</p>

<p>Here's a link to the <a href="/">homepage</a>. You know, just in case.</p>
