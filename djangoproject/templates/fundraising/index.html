<h2 id="fellowship-program">Django Fellowship Program</h2>

<p>The biggest expense of the <abbr title="Django Software Foundation">DSF</abbr>
  is the Django Fellowship program. It's a project where
  <a href="#who-is-the-django-fellow">a paid contractor</a> is engaged to
  manage some of the administrative and community management tasks of the
  Django project to support rapid development of Django itself.</p>

<p><strong>The first year of the Django Fellowship program was very successful.</strong>
  The Django Fellow triages 10-15 new tickets each week and reviews and merges
  around fifteen non-trivial patches a week from community members and core
  developers. For the first time in Django's history, we had releases according
  to schedule (Django 1.8 and 1.9). You can read a retrospective on the things
  that were accomplished in <a href="/weblog/2015/jan/21/django-fellowship-retrospective/">
  the first three months of the program</a> on our blog. A retrospective for the
  rest of the year is coming soon.</p>

<h1>We need your help!</h1>

<p>The program has a major positive impact on how Django is developed and
   maintained. Release blocking and severe bugs are not postponed indefinitely.
   The Django Fellow is a resource to help review patches and contributions
   from the community, and the community loves that:</p>

<p><strong>If you use Django on a daily basis and care about the development of Django
   itself, you should donate today</strong> (may be <a href="/foundation/donate/#tax-deductible">tax deductible</a>).
   Only with your support can we make sure that the Web framework you base your work on
   can grow to be even better in the coming years.</p>

<h1 id="benevity-giving">Benevity Workplace Giving Program</h1>

<p>The DSF is pleased to be a participant in the <strong>Benevity Workplace Giving Program</strong>.
   When your employer becomes a member of the Benevity community, you are able to make donations to
   the DSF via payroll deduction. Many employers offer a matching contribution as well, increasing
   the amount that the DSF receives from your donation.</p>
<p>Benevity is available to employers in any country, and works with your companyâ€™s payroll department
   for ease of use from set up to payments.</p>
<p>Check with your employer to see if they participate in Benevity, or visit the Benevity site at

        <h2>What is the Django Software Foundation?</h2>
        <p>Development of Django is supported by an independent foundation
          established as a 501(c)(3) non-profit. Like most open-source foundations,
          the goal of the <a href="/foundation/">Django Software Foundation</a>
          is to promote, support, and advance the Django Web framework. If you're
          interested in how the Django Software Foundation supports the Django
          Web framework, we published a
          <a href="/weblog/2015/jan/08/django-software-foundation-2014/">Summary
          of 2014. </a>

        <h2 id="who-is-the-django-fellow">Who is the Django Fellow?</h2>
        <p><strong>Tim Graham</strong> - a member of the core team for several years. For
        the 12 months before the fellowship began, he was a major contributor,
        reviewing and merging pull requests. Tim was contracted as a full-time
        Fellow for the duration of the 3 month pilot and continued when the
        program was renewed in March 2015.</p>
