<h1>About the program</h1>
<p>Django Fellowship is a project where paid contractors are engaged to manage
  some of the administrative and community management tasks of the Django
  project to support rapid development of Django itself. </p>

<p><strong>The first three months of the Django Fellowship program were very successful.</strong>
  In this short time, two Django Fellows, one full-time and one part-time, worked on
  around 240 pull requests (including reviewing some of the major features that
  are in <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/releases/1.8/">Django 1.8</a>),
  triaged at least 90 different tickets, and made around 200 commits in total!
  You can read <a href="/weblog/2015/jan/21/django-fellowship-retrospective/">
  the retrospective on the things that have been accomplished</a> on our blog.</p>

<p>The program was renewed in March 2015 after the initial fundraising efforts
   to renew the program succeeded.</P>

<h1>We need your help!</h1>

<p>The program has already had a major positive impact on how Django is developed
   and maintained. Release blocking and severe bugs are not postponed indefinitely. Django
   Fellows are a resource to help review patches and contributions from the community, and
   the community loves that:</p>

<p><strong>If you use Django on a daily basis and care about the development of Django
   itself, you should donate today</strong> (may be <a href="/foundation/donate/#tax-deductible">tax deductible</a>).
   Only with your support can we make sure that the Web framework you base your work on
   can grow to be even better in the coming years.</p>

<p>The weekly cost of the program is about US&nbsp;$2,800.00.
   Your donations sustain the program.</p>

<h1>Benevity Workplace Giving Program</h1>

<p>The DSF is pleased to be a participant in the <strong>Benevity Workplace Giving Program</strong>.
   When your employer becomes a member of the Benevity community, you are able to make donations to
   the DSF via payroll deduction. Many employers offer a matching contribution as well, increasing
   the amount that the DSF receives from your donation.</p>
<p>Benevity is available to employers in any country, and works with your companyâ€™s payroll department
   for ease of use from set up to payments.</p>
<p>Check with your employer to see if they participate in Benevity, or visit the Benevity site at
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.benevity.com">www.benevity.com</a> to find out more if your
   employer is not yet part of the Benevity program.</p>

        <h2>What is the Django Software Foundation?</h2>
        <p>Development of Django is supported by an independent foundation
          established as a 501(c)(3) non-profit. Like most open-source foundations,
          the goal of the <a href="/foundation/">Django Software Foundation</a>
          is to promote, support, and advance the Django Web framework. If you're
          interested in how the Django Software Foundation supports the Django
          Web framework, we published a
          <a href="/weblog/2015/jan/08/django-software-foundation-2014/">Summary
          of 2014. </a>
        </p>

        <h2>Who is the Django Fellow?</h2>
        <p><strong>Tim Graham</strong> - a member of the core team for several years. For
        the 12 months before the fellowship began, he was a major contributor,
        reviewing and merging pull requests. Tim was contracted as a full-time
        Fellow for the duration of the 3 month pilot and continued when the
        program was renewed in March 2015.</p>
